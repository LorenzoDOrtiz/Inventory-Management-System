# Inventory Management System

## Introduction
In software development, creating applications to meet specific business requirements is a common task. This Inventory Management System project simulates the process of developing an application from gathering requirements to implementation. It serves as a practical demonstration of software engineering principles using C#.

## Scenario
This project addresses the needs of a small manufacturing organization that requires a more sophisticated inventory system than their current spreadsheet-based solution. The organization provided a mock-up of the user interface and a class diagram to guide the development process. Specific business requirements were translated into solution statements to develop the application.

## Requirements
This project involves creating a C# application based on the provided GUI mock-up and UML class diagram. The application should include:
- User interface components such as main form, add part form, modify part form, add product form, and modify product form.
- Implementation of appropriate classes, methods, and properties as specified in the UML class diagram.
- Behaviors for adding, modifying, and deleting parts and products.
- Data validation to prevent input errors and ensure data integrity.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LorenzoDOrtiz/inventory-management.git
   ```
2. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application from Visual Studio.

## Usage
1. **Main Form**: Use the buttons to add, modify, delete, or search for parts and products. Exit the application using the "Exit" button.
2. **Add Part Form**: Enter details for a new part, select whether it's in-house or outsourced, and save or cancel the entry.
3. **Modify Part Form**: Modify existing part details and save or cancel the changes.
4. **Add Product Form**: Create a new product, associate parts, and save or cancel the entry.
5. **Modify Product Form**: Modify product details, adjust associated parts, and save or cancel the changes.
